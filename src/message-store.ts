   * (`round(sum(raw) * factor)`) is NOT generally equal to summing
   * individually-rounded calibrated block estimates
   * (`sum(round(raw * factor))`) for a fractional calibration factor and a
   * multi-block message — e.g. two 1-token raw blocks at calibration 0.6:
   * round(2 * 0.6) = 1, but round(1*0.6) + round(1*0.6) = 1 + 1 = 2, which
   * is what a live `estimateTokens` call actually returns. Storing
   * `rawBlockEstimates` and replaying the exact same per-block
   * round-then-sum at read time (see getChannelTokenStats) keeps the
   * cached and live paths in agreement for every message, not just
   * single-block ones.
   *
   * Values are NOT the calibrated estimate either, for the same reason:
   * `estimateTokens` bakes in the mutable `tokenCalibration` multiplier
   * (see setTokenCalibration), and caching ITS output would freeze each
   * entry at whatever calibration was in effect when first computed —
   * silently mixing calibration generations within one aggregate response,
   * since `setTokenCalibration` is called during normal operation (the
   * autobiographical strategy's closed-loop calibration), not just in
   * synthetic tests. Calibration is applied at READ time instead (see
   * getChannelTokenStats), so every entry always reflects the CURRENT
   * calibration with no invalidation needed when it changes.
   *
   * `channelId: undefined` means "looked up, has no (valid string)
   * channel" (still cached, so a range full of unchanneled messages
   * doesn't get re-decoded every call) as distinct from "not yet looked
   * up" (absent from the map). A non-string channelId value (`null`, a
   * number, …) is normalized to `undefined` here too — see
   * extractChannelId — matching chronicle's native String-kind field
   * index, which silently excludes non-string values rather than exposing
   * them as their own bucket (so byChannel never disagrees with
   * getChannelCounts about which messages are "channeled").
   *
   * There is no native token-estimate index — token estimation isn't a
   * field that exists on stored messages (see the design plan's "Scope
   * decision": indexing it natively would mean either rewriting every
   * historical message to stamp a field that predates the feature, or
   * leaving the index blank for all existing history; neither is
   * acceptable). This cache amortizes the one genuinely expensive part —
   * decoding content (blob resolution) and running raw token estimation —
   * across repeated getChannelTokenStats calls over overlapping ranges,
   * filled lazily only for ordinals actually requested.
   *
   * KNOWN SIMPLIFICATION, not a bug: entries are never evicted or
   * write-through'd on edit/remove within a branch — each entry is a
   * handful of tiny scalars, not message content, so this stays cheap even
   * at hundreds of thousands of messages, nothing like the content-bearing
