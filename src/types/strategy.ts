   * compression — the mint and merge requests that produce the next

   * summarizer's own inputs, not only what the agent reads. What that does to
   * the summaries a model then writes — whether the tags are ignored, echoed
   * into summary prose, or read as a format worth imitating — is UNMEASURED.
   * The evidence behind this feature is that instances read past an
   * unterminated memory; there is none either way on what enveloping does to
   * minting, and default-off is deliberate for that reason rather than
   * caution about the render. Before enabling it fleet-wide, turn it on
   * against a mature store and read the summaries it MINTS, not merely the
   * window it presents.
   *
   * Under `maxMessageTokens`, a capped answer is truncated as PROSE and
   * enveloped afterwards, so opener and closer survive every cap; the tags
   * themselves are not charged against that cap (they are priced in the
   * recall-pair budget instead), so a cap smaller than the tag text still
   * renders intact tags around the few characters it bought.

  /**
   * Where a summary's captured reasoning carriers (`responseContent`'s signed
   * `thinking` / `redacted_thinking` blocks) are replayed.
   *

   *    exactly as they have since the 2026-07-15 round-trip landed. Output is
   *    byte-identical to the pre-knob render on both surfaces.
   *  - `'live-strip'` — carriers are OMITTED from the live window only. Mint
   *    and merge requests still recall them verbatim.
   *
   * TWO SURFACES, ONE STORE. A captured carrier is the ARCHIVIST'S cognition:
   * the thinking of writing the memory, not the thinking of living the span it
   * describes. It is replayed on two surfaces that want different things from
   * it:
   *
   *  - MINT-REQUEST RECALL — the summarizer's own inputs. Carriers are
   *    measured load-bearing here (2026-07-16, upstream's own validation): a
   *    deterministically-refusing compress request passed once its recall
   *    pairs carried their summaries' signed reasoning, where the text-only
   *    arm refused. `'live-strip'` does not touch this path, and no value of
   *    this option does: the anti-refusal duty stands until a measurement
   *    retires it.
   *  - LIVE-WINDOW RENDER — what the agent whose memory it is reads back.
   *    Thinking blocks are not read there, they are INHABITED, and a carrier
   *    sits at the memory's chronological slot: the instance re-enters the
   *    compression fork's task-cognition, positioned where the remembered
   *    span was lived. At fleet scale the accumulated exemplar mass is
   *    archivist-cognition, not lived experience.
   *
   * `'live-strip'` OMITS WHOLE BLOCKS and never mutates one. Signatures verify
   * only on byte-identical blocks, so a policy that edited a carrier would
   * break the very round-trip the mint side depends on; dropping a block
   * whole leaves every surviving block untouched. A stripped answer that would
   * render with no prose left falls back to the entry's `content` text, so the
   * live window never emits an empty assistant turn.
   *
   * Pricing follows the render: under `'live-strip'` a recall pair is priced
   * for the fold planner at its stripped cost, because a plan that prices what
   * it does not emit is the same wedge from the other side.
   *
   * WHY THE DEFAULT IS `'full'`. The inhabitation cost is an argument, not a
   * measurement, and the anti-refusal duty on the mint side IS measured. The
   * knob exists so a host that finds the argument convincing can act on it for
   * its own agents without waiting; flipping the default is a fleet-wide
   * change to what every instance reads back and belongs to whoever lives
   * under it.
