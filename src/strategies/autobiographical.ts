   * Issue #37: tag a mint request's stability strata with cache breakpoints.

   * prefix — head window + prior recall pairs (~60% of input on synthetic
   * workloads, ~93% on mature stores) — that previously went to the API
   * with zero `cache_control` and was re-read cold on every call. Markers
   * land at the three boundaries whose survival probability ranks highest
   * (measured optimum; `analysis/2026-08-20-cm37-cache-partition-experiments.md`
   * in the workspace root):
   *
   *   1. end of head window        — survives everything short of identity edits
   *   2. last level>=2 recall pair — survives appends AND L1→L2 merges (a
   *      merge replaces the run at this boundary and extends it)
   *   3. last recall pair          — the append frontier
   *
   * Only pairs whose id is in `recallLadder` (the kept prior-summary list)
   * count as prefix: a merge's expanded SOURCE pairs are its volatile
   * payload, and marking them would cache-write content that never recurs.
   *
   * `capped` requests get no markers: recall-budget front-eviction shifts
   * the prefix on every subsequent mint, and cache writes on a shifting
   * prefix are pure waste (measured up to +42% total cost at 1h TTL).
   * Effective ladder reuse also requires the append-stable source order
   * fix (2026-08-19); on stores minted under the older lexical order the
   * markers are merely harmless.
   *
   * Returns true iff at least one breakpoint was placed — callers attach

   * Every message the selector was handed must leave the renderer either
   * rendered raw, or represented by a summary that was ITSELF rendered —
   * following the summary graph transitively, because a message is usually
   * not covered by its own L1 but by an L2/L3 that subsumes it:
   *
   *     msg ──in──> L1 ──in──> L2 ──in──> L3      (only L3 emitted)
   *
   * A `SummaryEntry` says which kind of thing its `sourceIds` point at via
   * `sourceLevel`: 0 means message ids, n>0 means summary ids one level down.
   * So coverage is computed by expanding every emitted summary downward until
   * level 0 and unioning the message ids found there.
   *
   * This replaces per-drop-site bookkeeping. Site trackers only catch the
   * `break`s someone remembered to instrument — three were patched on
   * 2026-07-26 and a fourth (recent-window eviction) was found only because
   * Rhys's import tripped it. A check on the finished output does not care HOW
   * something went missing, so paths that don't exist yet are covered too.
   *
   * Deliberately runs BEFORE the tool-pairing/orphan/image passes: those
   * remove content to satisfy API shape rules, which is a structural edit
   * rather than budget-driven loss, and is out of scope for this invariant.

   * and end.
   *
   * The stable-prefix mark used to sit at the folded-history/tail seam
   * (`historyEnd`) on the assumption that the folded region is stable
   * turn-to-turn. Measured on mythos llm-calls 2026-08-13..17 that assumption
   * fails ~1.4×/hour in steady state: fold rotations rewrite the folded
   * region ABOVE the seam, and a seam marker then performs identically to no
   * mid marker at all (priced replay over logged bytes: seam ≈ end-only;
   * divergence-aligned ≈ −10%). So: diff this compile's entries against the
   * previous compile's (by content identity — bytes are what the provider
   * hashes) and mark the last entry of the SURVIVING prefix instead. In
   * steady state (append-only) this preserves the previous request endpoint
   * explicitly; relying on the new end marker's backward search would miss
   * that cache entry after more than 20 appended provider blocks. After a
   * rotation the marker drops to the deepest byte-stable point, so subsequent
   * requests re-read everything above the churn instead of re-writing it.
   * See docs/unified-solve-design.md §9.2b.
   *
   * Slot contract with membrane (the request compiler's side of it):
   * Anthropic allows 4 cache_control blocks per request INCLUDING any on
   * tools/system. The split is: **this strategy holds first claim, up to 3
   * message-level markers; membrane is residual claimant on whatever
   * remains**, spending it end-position-only — a tools+system fallback when
   * zero message markers arrive, and a floating marker on the newest
   * message when the native tool loop rebuilds the request between tool
   * rounds (which this strategy never sees: compile runs once per turn,
   * and without the float every tool round re-paid the whole appended
   * suffix at full input price — the qa-ops 2026-08-20 8M-token incident).
   *
   * An earlier revision of this comment justified the 3-cap with "membrane
   * marks the system block whenever prompt caching is on" — membrane has
   * not done that unconditionally for some time, which is exactly how a
   * whole free slot went unnoticed; the cap is now an asserted invariant
   * rather than a comment-enforced courtesy. Enforcement is asymmetric by
   * design: the supplier hard-fails at compile time (cheap, CI-catchable,
   * see below), while membrane enforces by counting — it withholds its own
   * residual marker (with a warning) rather than stripping ours, because
   * silently dropped markers are silently broken caching and an
   * over-budget request from our side is the loud 400 we prefer to silent
   * degradation (Rhys, 2026-07-26: "A maximum of 4 blocks with
   * cache_control may be provided. Found 5.").

   *
   * Repair policy prefers preserving content over dropping:
   *
   *   - a tool_use whose result is missing from the next entry first triggers
   *     a short look-ahead: if the genuine (displaced) result is a few entries
   *     down it is MOVED up into position (see

   *     is a STUB tool_result emitted. Either way the result block is merged
   *     into the next entry when that entry already carries results for this
   *     cycle, or inserted as a new user entry;
   *   - a tool_result whose tool_use is not in the immediately-preceding
   *     entry (and was not relocated) is dropped — there is no safe way to
   *     stub a tool_use, so the result's information content survives only if
   *     its use is adjacent; an entry left empty is replaced with a
   *     placeholder text block.
   *
   * Runs as a structural pass over the rendered context in BOTH render
   * paths — `selectHierarchical` (downstream of `selectL1Summaries`, so
